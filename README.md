# Round-Robin-CPU-Scheduling
This repository contains an implementation of the Round Robin CPU Scheduling Algorithm, a widely used preemptive scheduling technique in operating systems. Round Robin ensures fair CPU allocation by assigning a fixed time quantum to each process in a cyclic order, reducing response time and preventing starvation.
